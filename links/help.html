            <h2>Frequently Asked Questions</h2>
            <p>How do I book a ride?</p>
            <p>Booking a ride with TripLink is easy! Simply visit our website or mobile app, enter your pickup location,
                destination, date, and time, and browse through the available ride options. Once you've selected your
                preferred ride, confirm your booking and get ready to enjoy a seamless journey.</p>
            <p>Can I change my pickup location after booking?</p>
            <p>Yes, it is possible to change your pickup location after booking, but it depends on the specific
                circumstances and the availability of drivers in your new pickup location. We recommend contacting our
                customer support team as soon as possible to request a pickup location change. They will assist you in
                making the necessary adjustments and accommodate your request to the best of their abilities. Please
                note that changes to the pickup location may impact the estimated arrival time and fare calculation, so
                we advise reaching out to us at the earliest convenience for a smooth and hassle-free experience.</p>
            <p>How can I contact TripLink customer support?</p>

            <p>What happens if my TripLink driver cancels the ride?</p>
            <p>While rare, if your TripLink driver cancels the ride, we apologize for any inconvenience caused. Rest
                assured, we will make every effort to assign an alternate driver to ensure your ride is completed as
